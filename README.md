# cornerContourCeramicTest

_Edited by jeremyfa to install libs via haxelib/ceramic instead of embedding these in src. And fixed mesh color display ( on my mac still have to copy into local src all haxelibs but may need to update my local version? )_


basic test of cornerContour with ceramic, just relevant src folder that works with basic ceramic setup, have manually added my required haxelibs, since no idea how that aspect is setup.
